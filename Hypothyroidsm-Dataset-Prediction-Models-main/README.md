# Hypothyroidsm-Dataset-Prediction-Models
Hypothyroidism Prediction Models: A Case of Nairobi Hospital.


Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to build a model that predicts the likelyhood of a patient having hypothyroidism from their symptoms.

# Understanding the context.

The thyroid is a gland that produces thyroid hormone which regulates vital body functions. There are several conditions which are brough about by failure of the thyroid to function normally.

This exercise focuses on Hypothyroidism and seeks to predict the likelyhood of a patient to have hypothyroidism based on tests conducted and the features in the provided dataset.

# Experimental Design.

The experimental design for this project will be composed of Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction Models as shown below.

Exploratory Data Analysis.

* Univariate Analysis.
* Bivariate Analysis.

Prediction

* Random Forest.
* AdaBoost.
* Gradient Boost.
* Support Vector Machine.

# Defining the Metrics for Success.

The Accuracy score,f1 score, Precision and Confusion Matrix will be used to evaluate the prediction of the of models.
